How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed?

```ruby
def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
```

My answer

```ruby
def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end
```

Note: It says one is harder to read than the other, I wonder which one is that pointing to?
