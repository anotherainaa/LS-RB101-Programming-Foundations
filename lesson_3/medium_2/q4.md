```ruby
def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

Note
---
- It seems like this method is doing the same thing as the first one. However, this is achieveing the opposite result of the first method. 

Now, the display will be as below: 
```ruby
puts "My string looks like this now: pumpkinsrutabaga"
puts "My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]"
```

- in this case, the string is modified while the array stays the same. 
- all about what ruby does with local variables when we change the object it points to.
