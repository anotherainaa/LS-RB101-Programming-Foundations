Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

```ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

My answer
---
What will be displayed:
```ruby
My string looks like this now: pumpkins
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins" , "rutabaga"]
```

Why:
When the variable, `my_string` and `my_array` are passed to the method, 
a reference to the object is passed. 

In the case of the string, the string method `#+` does not modify the original string. 
While on the array side,  array method `#<<` modifies the original array. 

Notes
---
- Both array and string parameters are treated the same way. 
- read pass by reference article again
- hand write notes + create flash card where necessary
