```ruby
def foo(param = "no")
  "yes"
end

def bar(param = "no")
  param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
end
```

What would be the return value of the following method invocation?

```ruby
bar(foo)
```

My answer

Return value is `"no"`  because the return value of `foo` is `"yes"`. 

Value `"yes"` is passed as an argument into method `bar(param)` where `"yes" == "no" ?` evaluates to `false` . This return value of `false` is `"no"`

=> This is because the value returned from the `foo` method will always be `"yes"` , and `"yes" == "no"` will be false.
