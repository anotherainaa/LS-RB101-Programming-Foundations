```Ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end

mess_with_demographics(munsters)
```

Did the family's data get ransacked? Why or why not?

My answer
---
Yes, because `=` for a hash is not reassignment and overwrites the original value.

=> because under the hood, ruby passes the object id of each item rather than the value of the parameter
=> `demo_hash` starts off pointing to the munsters hash.
=> the program does not reassign `demo_hash`

Note
---
- I initially thought this does not modify the original array because of the usage of method `each` and did not pay attention to the object that is being passed in.
