```ruby
def rps(fist1, fist2)
  if fist1 == "rock"
    (fist2 == "paper") ? "paper" : "rock"
  elsif fist1 == "paper"
    (fist2 == "scissors") ? "scissors" : "paper"
  else
    (fist2 == "rock") ? "rock" : "scissors"
  end
end
```

What is the result of the following call?

```ruby
puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")
```

In order to find result, the first methods that needs to be evaluated are `rps("rock", "paper")` and `rps("rock", "scissors")`  in the middle. 

These functions returns `"paper"` and `"rock"` respectively which leaves us with:

```ruby
rps(rps("paper", "rock"), "rock)"
```

The inner `rps` method returns `"paper"` and finally leaving `rps("paper", "rock")` which evaluates to `"paper"`.

Notes:
- Study LS explanation and compare which one is easier to understand.
