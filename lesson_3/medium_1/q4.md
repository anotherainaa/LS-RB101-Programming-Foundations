Question 4
--- 

Is there a difference between the two?

```Ruby
def rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer << new_element
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

def rolling_buffer2(input_array, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer = input_array + [new_element]
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end
```

My solution

Yes. Method `rolling_buffer1` modifies the original array passed into it. 
While in method `rolling_buffer2`, the original array is not modified. `input_array` is reassigned to `buffer` which points to a new object containing the original array concatenated with the `new_element`. 

=> `rolling_buffer2` will not alter the caller's input argument.
