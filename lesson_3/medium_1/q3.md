Question 3 
--- 
```Ruby
def factors(number)
  divisor = number
  factors = []
  begin
    factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
    divisor -= 1
  end until divisor == 0
  factors
end
```
My solution
---

```Ruby
def factors(number)
  factors = []
  (1..number).each do |n|
    factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
  end
  factors
end
```

Bonus 1
---
What is the purpose of the `number % divisor == 0` ?
The purpose is to check and ensure that the number is divisible by divisor without any remainders

=> Allows you to determine if the result of the division is an integer number (no remainder).

Bonus 2
--- 
What is the purpose of the second-to-last line (line 8) in the method (the factors before the method's end)?
To ensure the method returns the output that is expected in this method which is factors of `number`

=>  If we omitted this line, the code would execute, but the return value of the method would be nil.

Notes
---
- Try to solve this again using `while` loop and note the differences of using `while` and `until`
