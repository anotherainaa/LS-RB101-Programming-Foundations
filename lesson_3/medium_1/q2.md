Question 2
---

The result of the following statement will be an error:

```ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)
```

Why is this and what are two possible ways to fix this?

This returns a TypeError because `(40 + 2)` is not converted into a string. 

Solution 1 
---
Use `#to_s` to convert the result of `(40 + 2)` into a string

```Ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s
```

Solution2 
---
Use string interpolation

```Ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + "#{(40 + 2)}"
```

which can be simplified to

```Ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"
```

LS Solution

This will raise an error TypeError: no implicit conversion of Fixnum into String because (40+2) results in an integer and it is being concatenated to a string.
